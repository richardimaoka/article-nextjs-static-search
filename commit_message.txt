feat: Enhance DetailedSearch button and animated rectangle with dynamic styles

This commit enhances the `DetailedSearch` client component with the following features:

- **Dynamic Button Styling:** The "詳細検索" button now dynamically changes its text to "閉じる"
  and flips its color scheme (white background, black text) when pressed, and reverts
  when closed. This is achieved by conditionally applying the `detailedSearchButtonActive` class.
- **Bordered Animated Rectangle:** The animated rectangle is now enclosed within a new `div`
  (`animatedRectangleContainer`) which has a border, improving its visual presentation.
  The container also animates its height and opacity for a smooth reveal/hide effect.

Corresponding styles have been added/modified in `app/search/DetailedSearch.module.css`
to support these new dynamic behaviors and visual elements.
