refactor: Make category checkboxes uncontrolled in DetailedSearch component

This commit refactors the `DetailedSearch` client component (`app/search/DetailedSearch.tsx`)
to manage category selection using native HTML input values rather than React controlled state.

Changes include:
- Removal of `selectedCategories` state and `handleCategoryChange` function.
- Category checkboxes are now rendered as uncontrolled inputs with a `name="categories[]"` attribute,
  allowing their values to be potentially collected by a parent form submission.
